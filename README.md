# beautifulplots

Python plotting library for beautiful, easy, and sophisticated matplotlib based plots. Compatible with Matplotlib graphs, such as Pandas and Seaborn. 

Python, along with Pandas, and Nummpy are the data scientist analysis tool of choice. Correspondingly, data visualization is required for analysis, investigation, and insight. In the data science analysis Matplotlib based plotting libraries are reputedly the most powerful and customizable. However, creating the necessary graphs often diverges from the primary goal. Graphs resulting from data science analysis inevitably populate reports, presentations, and even interactive web graphics. Unfortunately, plotting a beautiful graph often requires a non-trivial surrounding software code. After some experience, use case after use case requires very similar surrounding code. 

The end goal of the beautifulplots plotting library is to package graphing functions for the easy generation of beautiful graphs without the burden of distracting code.
